This is a parallel implementation of the CUBEP<sup>3</sup>M algorithm in Fortran 90 based on code found [here](https://github.com/jharno/cubep3m). No changes have been made to the original code, except for the Makefile. You can read more about the algorithm [here (instructions/basic description)](https://wiki.cita.utoronto.ca/index.php/CubePM#Basic_CubeP.5E3M_algorithm) and [here (academic paper)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.5098.pdf).
