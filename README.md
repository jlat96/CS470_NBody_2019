# CS 470 Research - NBody Problem
## src
This directory contains all source code for the three impmenentations we analyized in order to simulate the N-Bodies Problem. All of our directories tackle the problem of gravitational N-Bodies, other forces are not taken into account.
### Barnes-Hut Similation
This directory contains the Barnes-Hut simulation code, which is written in C++. The code was originally implemented by @barkm on Github and the original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/barkm/n-body). We manipulated the code so that we could time it. Further details on this repository can be found within the folder it is currently in.
### Fast-Multipole Method
This directory contains an implementation of the Fast Multipole Method, written in C. This code was originally implemented by @cfkane24 on Github and the original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/cfkane24/fast-multipole-method). Further details on this repository can be found within the folder it is currently in.
### Parker-Sochaki Method
This directory contains an implementation of the Parker-Sochaki Method, written in Fortran90. This code was originally implemented by Dr. C. David Pruett, Dr. William H. Ingham, and Dr. Ralph D. Herman and can be found written about [here](http://educ.jmu.edu/~sochacjs/PruettInghamHerman.pdf). Further details on this repository can be found within the folder it is currently in.
